Single crack mode: john --single --format=raw-sha1 crack.txt
Crack the password in file using wordlist: john --wordlist=/usr/share/john/password.lst --format=raw-sha1 crack.txt (Crack.txt here contains the hashes)

Cracking service credentials like ssh

1. First have to convert the hash file to JOHN format : ssh2john /home/text/.ssh/id_rsa > crack.txt (Now we need to crack this crack.txt file with John The Ripper)
2. john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt crack.txt

To crack ZIP

1. zip2john file.zip > crack.txt
2. john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt crack.txt



Notes:
â€“wordlist can be written as -w also

john crack.txt --wordlist=rockyou.txt --format=Raw-SHA256
